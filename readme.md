#### This is a repo to perform high level scripting of Catia V5 R21.

##### Code used: VB6 / VBA

###### Status: A part can be loaded and duplicated.
More details: This is WIP, mostly because the Catia macro recorder is unreliable.

##### Best-practise: Use Power Copy > KWA > KWB > Black Box
* Remark, VB can be integrated to Power Copy / KWA / KWB.
* Remark2 : This is potentially obsolete. Use case was for Aerospace Industry
* Remark3 : Some good results can be reached without recoding tools in C.
* Remark4 : KWB requires a much more expensive license

##### How to test the API?
  Catia API can be used like an excel spreadshit, just press Alt-F11 to start the high level VB6 environment.
  Keep in mind that VB6 and VBA are not exactly the same.
  Remark : Catia can be started in demo mode (without lic) for educationnal purpose only(beware of corrupted metadata)
