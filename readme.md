# This is a repo to perform high level scripting of Catia V5 R21.

### Code used: VB6 / VBA

### Status: A part can be loaded and duplicated.
### More details: This is very WIP, mostly because the Catia macro recorder is pure garbage.

### W/A & Advice: Use Power Copy > KWA > KWB > Black Box
### Remark, VB can be integrated to Power Copy / KWA / KWB.
### Remark2 : This is potentially highly obsolete/deprecated!
