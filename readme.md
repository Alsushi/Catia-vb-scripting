#### This is a repo to perform high level scripting of Catia V5 R21.

##### Code used: VB6 / VBA

###### Status: A part can be loaded and duplicated.
More details: This is WIP, mostly because the Catia macro recorder is unreliable.

##### Best-practise: Use Power Copy > KWA > KWB > Black Box
* Remark, VB can be integrated to Power Copy / KWA / KWB.
* Remark2 : This is potentially obsolete. Use case was for Aerospace Industry
* Remark3 : Some good results can be reached without recoding tools in C.
